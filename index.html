  <h3>What I look for</h3>
  <p>If you want me to work with you, there's three things I like for in every opportunity.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col4">
      <p class="heading">Smart People</p>
      <p>I maximize for learning on a regular basis, and I think the best way to do that is to surround myself with really smart people. Am I working with people who have superpowers?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col4">
      <p class="heading">Autonomy</p>
      <p>I work best when empowered. That doesn't mean I want free reign, but that I feel I have the ability to control my own work and growth. I like to work outside the box.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col4">
      <p class="heading">Impact</p>
      <p>I care about my individual contributions impacting the world at large. How much will what I do actually impact the world at large in numbers of people and change felt?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>What you might look for</h3>
  <p>You can think of what I'm doing in two dimensions: areas of expertise and capability.</p>
